# A Redis in-memory DB can drastically speed up the performance of the bot.

# Install redis and then ensure that redis-server is started:

# Under the hood, the relayer will cache JSON-rpc request data from requests
# like `eth_getBlock` in the Redis DB.

# recommended to consult with the Across development team before making any
# changes to this section.


# List of destination chains to be supported by the relayer. If set to a
# non-empty list, only transfers going to these chains will be filled. For
# example, if set to [1], only transfers destined for Ethereum will be filled.
#RELAYER_DESTINATION_CHAINS=[1,10,137,288,42161]


# List of networks to monitor for deposit and fill events. This defaults to all
# all chains and shouldn't be updated unless:
#   (1) a network is down, or
#   (2) you want to explicitly skip all deposits from an origin chain.
# Note that this should not be used to skip deposits going TO a specific chain.
# RELAYER_DESTINATION_CHAINS should be used in that case instead.
#CONFIGURED_NETWORKS=[1,10,137,288,42161]


# List of tokens that the relayer supports. These are addresses on Ethereum
# mainnet. For example, if only USDC's address is specified, the relayer
# will only fill USDC transfers on the configured destination chains. If
# RELAYER_TOKENS is not set, or is set to [], the relayer will relay for any
# token that it holds a balance of. The bot internally identifies the
# corresponding L2/side chain contract address based on the L1 contract
# address.
#RELAYER_TOKENS=[]


# By default set to false. If false, the relayer will ignore any deposits that
# it cannot fully fill. A feature for partial fills is not yet implemented but
# it's possible to do so at the contract level. If this is set to true, then the
# relayer will fill the minimum possible amount of the deposited amount (i.e. 1
# wei for ETH), which will trigger a slow fill payment to be sent from the mainnet
# HubPool to the destination SpokePool. There is no benefit for a user to do this,
# and the system will function correctly as long as at least one relayer is
# handling slow relays. We recommend that you leave this value set to "false".
SEND_SLOW_RELAYS=false


# How many blocks to look back per request for a chain. Relayer code will bundle
# requests, so a lower number implies that there will be more requests to the
# RPC endpoint. This implies more request overhead and therefore impacts the
# speed at which the bot can operate. Some RPCs, like Infura, limit lookback to
# fixed number of blocks. The example configuration below is also the default
# behaviour of the bot and is known to work with Infura.
#MAX_BLOCK_LOOK_BACK='{
#  "1": 20000, "10": 20000, "137": 3499, "288": 4990, "42161": 99990
#}'


# How many blocks to lookback for Deposit events to be filled. The below ranges
# The below lookback ranges contain approximately 2 days of blocks for each
# network. This can be shortened to send fewer requests to the RPC endpoint and
# generally speed up the bot, at the risk of overlooking events that fall
# outside of the specified window. The example configuration below is also the
# default behaviour of the bot.
#MAX_RELAYER_DEPOSIT_LOOK_BACK='{

# This inventory config will be explained in greater detail in a separate
# section, but generally but generally this informs the relayer how it should
# rebalance token inventories across chains. The following simple example tells
# the bot that it should target holding 8% of its WETH on chain 10, 8% on chain
# 42161, 8% on chain 137, 0.2% on chain 288, and the remainder on Mainnet. The
# config can also be used to specify how much ETH versus WETH to hold.
