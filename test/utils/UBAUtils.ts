 * SpokePoolClients are not important. This is because we need at least one spoke pool client for every
 * available chain and we don't usually need all of the available spoke clients.
 * @param desiredClients An optional object that contains the desired spoke pool clients. If set, this will override/append to the default clients.
 * @returns An array of empty objects that are typed as SpokePoolClients
