// Reorgs are anticipated on Ethereum and Polygon. We use different following distances when processing deposit
// events based on the USD amount of the deposit. This protects the relayer from the worst case situation where it fills
// a large deposit (i.e. with an amount equal to a large amount of $$$) but the deposit is included in a re-orged
// block. This would cause the relayer to unintentionally send an invalid fill and not refunded. The tradeoff is that
// the larger the follow distance, the slower the relayer will be to fulfill deposits. Therefore, the following
// configuration allows the user to set higher follow distances for higher deposit amounts.
// The Key of the following dictionary is used as the USD threshold to determine the MDC:
// - Searching from highest USD threshold to lowest
// - If the key value is >= deposited USD amount, then use the MDC associated with the key for the origin chain
// - If no key values are >= depostied USD amount, use the "default" value for the origin chain
// - For example, a deposit on Polygon worth $90 would use the MDC associated with the 100 key and chain
// 137, so it would use a follow distance of 80 blocks, while a deposit on Polygon for $110 would use 1000
// key. A deposit of $1100 would use the "default" key
