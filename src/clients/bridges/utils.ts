/**
 * @notice This function is designed to be used in L2 chain adapters when identifying "finalized" cross
 * chain transfers. For certain L2 chains, sending WETH from L1 to L2 is impossible so the EOA is forced to
 * first unwrap the WETH into ETH via the AtomicWethDepositor contract before receiving ETH to their L2 EOA. As
 * a final step, the EOA must wrap the ETH back into WETH. This function is designed to be used to match the
 * receipt of ETH on L2 with the wrapping of ETH into WETH on L2 to produce a single stream of "finalized" cross
 * chain transfers.
 * @dev Matching wrap and deposit finalized events is inexact because the wrapped amount usually differs
 * slightly from the deposited amount due to fees and inventory management logic. This function therefore
 * coarsely matches L2 deposit events with L2 wrap events by finding the first wrap event following the deposit
 * event. This wrap event is then removed from a list and cannot be matched with any other deposit event. Since
 * wrapping ETH is only expected to be done by this relayer, then this is a very accurate proxy for deciding
 * when WETH cross chain transfers have finalized into the relayer's L2 WETH inventory.
 * @dev This function is used in the WethBridge class in the OP stack and the ZkSyncAdapter.
 * @param l2EthDepositEvents List of L2 DepositFinalized events emitted when the EOA receives ETH on L2.
 * @param _l2WrapEvents List of L2 Wrap events emitted when the EOA wraps ETH into WETH on L2.
 * @returns List of l2EthDepositEvents followed by a l2WrapEvent. None of the
 * l2EthDepositEvents will match with the same l2WrapEvent.
