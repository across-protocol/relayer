    // Determine the spoke client's lookback:
    // 1. We initiate the spoke client event search windows based on a start bundle's bundle block end numbers and
    //    how many bundles we want to look back from the start bundle blocks.
    // 2. For example, if the start bundle is 100 and the lookback is 16, then we will set the spoke client event
    //    search window's toBlocks equal to the 100th bundle's block evaluation numbers and the fromBlocks equal
    //    to the 84th bundle's block evaluation numbers.
    // 3. Once we do all the querying, we figure out the earliest block that we‚Äôre able to validate per chain. This
    //    is simply equal to the first block queried per chain.
    // 4. If the earliest block we can validate is later than some target fully executed bundle's start blocks,
    //    then extend the SpokePoolClients' lookbacks and update again. Do this up to a specified # of retries.
    //    By dynamically increasing the range of Deposit events to at least cover the target bundle's
    //    start blocks, we can reduce the error rate. This is because of how the disputer and proposer will handle
    //    the case where it can't validate a fill without loading an earlier block.
    // 5. If the bundle we‚Äôre trying to validate or propose requires an earlier block, then exit early and
